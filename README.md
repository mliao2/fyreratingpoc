fyre rating proof of concept
=====

Using ratings collections 

Usage
-----------------------
Clone repo. 
cd into directory.
If you have python installed, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3007` (otherwise, start a webserver with access to that directory).
Navigate to localhost:3007

Notes
-----------------------
This is merely a small proof of concept to illustrate Livefyre's ratings collection. It runs off of a UAT environment, has a user's token hard coded, and has not been tested across browsers.
